# QC for EC: A Hands-On Quantum Computing Workshop

Welcome to the official repository for the **Hands-On Quantum Computing Workshop** for the Computer Engineering department at the University of Tripoli! This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks and materials you'll need to participate.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the workshop notebooks, you have two options. For the workshop itself, we will be using **Option 1 (Google Colab)** as it requires no local installation.

### Option 1: Running on Google Colab (Recommended)

Google Colab provides a free, in-browser environment to run our notebooks. All you need is a Google account.

1.  **Navigate to a Notebook:** Go to one of the notebook files in this repository (e.g., `01-Fundamentals.ipynb`).
2.  **Open in Colab:** Look for the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the file preview and click it. 
    * *If you don't see a button*, you can manually open it. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com), click `File -> Open notebook`, select the "GitHub" tab, and paste the URL of this repository.
3.  **Run the Setup:** Once the notebook is open in Colab, the first thing you must do is run the setup cell at the top. This will install Qiskit and all the necessary libraries into your Colab environment.

That's it! You're ready to follow along.

### Option 2: Running Locally with Anaconda

If you prefer to run the notebooks on your own machine, you can use Anaconda and Jupyter.

1.  **Install Anaconda:** If you don't already have it, download and install the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which includes Python, Jupyter, and many other useful tools.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Open a terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and clone this repository to your computer using `git`:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Abdulmalek-HoM/QC-for-EC-Workshop.git](https://github.com/Abdulmalek-HoM/QC-for-EC-Workshop.git)
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd QC-for-EC-Workshop
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter Lab interface.

5.  **Open a Notebook:** From the file browser on the left, click on a notebook file (e.g., `01-Fundamentals.ipynb`) to open it and get started.
